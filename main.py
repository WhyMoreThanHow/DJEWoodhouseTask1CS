Task 1:
Create a lottery number generator. This must generate 6 random numbers between 1
and 49 inclusive, and a bonus ball. The numbers must not repeat in any draw. Feel free
to “prettify” the text output.
Extension:
If you found the above quite simple, you can add the extension task. The lottery is an
example of a permutation without repetition. Your extension task is to get an input from
the user containing all 7 numbers. If the input is valid, show the user which of their
numbers were correct, and return the probability of him having chosen that combination
of numbers.
